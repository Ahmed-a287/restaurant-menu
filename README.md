Restaurant Menu App

Description
This is a Menu App that displays a list of meals categorized by type. The app fetches data from an external API, which includes meal categories and their respective meal names. The data is then displayed on the page, allowing users to view different types of meals available under each category (e.g., Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner).
The idea of the project is to replace the old paper menu with this app.

Features
Fetches data from a remote API and processes the response.

Displays meal categories (e.g., Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner) along with a list of meals in each category, and finally, a detailed meal description (ingredients).
Dynamically updates the content based on the fetched data.

Technology
In this app, I used Next.js (React) for the frontend, which is suitable for this kind of project. Some reasons why Next.js is a good choice:

Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
Static Site Generation (SSG)
Dynamic Routing
Fast Refresh
Built-in support for CSS and SASS, etc.

How It Works
The app uses the fetch function to make an API call to retrieve meal data categorized by type.
The response is parsed and processed, and the meals are organized by their categories. The app then renders the list of categories and the corresponding meals on the page.

The app is desigend to be used on diffrent (specific) platforms like large screens (laptops), tablets (iPad Air), and smartphones (iPhone 14 Pro Max).
